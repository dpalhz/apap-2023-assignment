# SILOGISTIK - APAP Express Logistics Information System

## Introduction

APAP Express, established in 2005, is one of the largest logistics service providers in Indonesia. With a network spanning over 20 cities, the company manages over 100,000 shipments and delivers more than 5 million items monthly.

## Problem Statement

As the company grows and the client base expands, APAP Express faces significant challenges in shipment management and tracking:

- Customer service receives over 200 calls daily regarding shipment status.
- Over 35% of customers report a lack of clarity regarding shipment status.
- More than 20% experience delivery delays.

These issues stem from a lack of coordination between departments, leading to data errors and tracking confusion.

## Solution

To address these problems, APAP Express' CEO has initiated the development of SILOGISTIK (Logistics Information System). This centralized platform aims to integrate all shipment requests, streamlining information flow and improving tracking accuracy.

- **Enhanced Customer Service Tools:** Tools to reduce customer service call volume and improve satisfaction.
